This project was undertaken to assess the profitbality of the UK football betting market using the Accumualtor betting method. Unfortunately, due to my Univrsity's regulations, I cannot publish the code here although I can explain the method and the findings briefly

## Method

Accumulator betting is the betting format on which you combine single-way bets into one large bet which pays off only if all the component bets also succeed. If one fails, the whole accumualtor fails. This was investigated due to the severe lack of research into this topic area, and so I thought it had potential to provide large profits.

To test this theory, I developed 4 different strategies to use with a range of different accumulator sizes to properly assess the profitability. The different strategies are encompassed in the grid below.
